# History App

## Introduction

History App is a mobile application designed for Android devices that allows users to find out which famous person in history passed away at the same age as them. This app was created with the aim of educating and entertaining users by providing interesting information about famous historical figures in an interactive and engaging way.

## Motivation

The idea for the History App came from my passion for history and technology. As a history enthusiast, I have always been fascinated by the lives and achievements of prominent historical figures. However, I've noticed that many people have a hard time connecting with the story in a meaningful way. By combining my passion for history with my knowledge of mobile app development, I decided to create the History App as a way to make history more accessible and interesting to a wider audience.

## Main Features

The History App offers the following main functionalities:

1. **Age Matching:** Users can enter their age into the app and find out which famous person in history passed away at the same age.
2. **List of Famous People:** The application includes a list of famous people, each with their age at death and occupation.
3. **Intuitive Interface:** The user interface design is intuitive and easy to use, making the user experience pleasant and engaging.
4. **Clear Results:** Users have the option to clear the input and results to make it easier to enter a new age.

## Technologies Used

History App is built in Kotlin, the official programming language for Android app development. Additionally, I used Android Studio as an integrated development environment (IDE) to create and test the application. To ensure a fluid and responsive user experience, I adopted UI design best practices from Material Design, powered by Google.

## How to use

To use the History App, follow these simple steps:

1. **Open the App:** Open the History App on your Android device.
2. **Enter Your Age:** On the app's home screen, you will find an input field where you can enter your age.
3. **Find a Famous Person:** After entering your age, click the "Find" button. The app will match your age with the age of a famous person in history and display information about that person on the screen.
4. **Clear Results (Optional):** If you wish to enter a new age, you can clear the results by clicking the "Clear" button.

## Code

The "**app**" folder is a fundamental part of the structure of an Android project in Android Studio. It contains most of the source code and resources for your Android app. Here's what you can find inside the "app" folder:

"**manifests**":

**AndroidManifest.xml**: This file contains essential information about your Android application, including configurations, permissions, and component definitions.

"**Kotlin + Java** ":

**com.example.myfirstapp**: This is the root folder of your app's source code packages. Inside, you will find the code packages organized by Java or Kotlin packages.

**com.example.myfirstapp (androidTest)**: This folder contains instrumentation tests for your Android app, which are tests performed on an Android device or emulator.

**com.example.myfirstapp (test)**: This folder contains unit tests for your Android app, which are tests that check the behavior of individual units of code.

"**res**" folder (**Resources**):

- **drawable**: This folder contains image files (e.g. PNG, JPEG) used in your application.
- **layout**: Here you will find the XML layout files that define the structure of your application's user interface (the application screens).
- **mipmap**: This folder contains your application icons at different screen densities.
- **values**: Here you will find XML files that define constant values, such as colors, strings and themes.

- **colors.xml**: Defines custom colors that can be used in your application.
- **strings.xml**: Stores the strings used in your application, allowing internationalization and localization.
- **themes**: Contains XML files that define the styles and themes applied to your application.

- **themes.xml**: Defines the general styles and themes of your application.

**XML**: This folder may contain other XML resources used in your application, such as menus or files.
